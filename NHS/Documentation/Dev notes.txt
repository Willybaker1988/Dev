02/06/2017:

Created a folder named BadData for files created 201606, GPADDR file has bad data in the Postcode attribute column. 
Further development needs to be made to the solution to deal with this scenario.

Logging needs to be in seconds

--DimGeneralPracticeAddress 


Created a Dim table for the DimGeneralPracticeAddress AS [Development].[DimGeneralPracticeAddress]

Need a table for Transform/Mirror and Datawarehouse.

Staging Dataset for ADDR persists "Blank" values rather than NULL values. Could update BLANKS to NULLS but would increase LOG space.
	-** Created script "ADDR UPDATE BLANKS TO NULLS"
	

12/06/2017:	
Created:

[Transform].[uspToTransformDimGeneralPracticeAddress]
	-Pulls the latest data from [Stage].[GPAddress] to [Transform].[DimGeneralPracticeAddress]


saved files in : C:\Users\william.baker\Documents\NHS\Development

21/07/2017:

Removed SLCD attributes in the [Mirror].[DimGeneralPracticeAddress]: 
IsActive
DateActiveFrom
DateActiveTo

Created table [Datawarehouse].[DimGeneralPracticeAddress], this dimension will be a type 2, 
if a GP's (GPid) Postcode chnages then the intial record "IsActive" attricbute set to "0" and DateActiveTo updated with the processing date
A new record will be created for the new Gp and location, the "IsActive" record will be set to "1" and DateActiveFrom updated with the processing date

**Still outstanding and needs implementing

27/07/2017:

Changes made to UspTransformDimGeneralPracticeAddress:
Added NOT IN clause to exclude FileLoadLog records being reprocessed into Transform table.

UspMirrorDimGeneralPracticeAddress
Added 2 new attributes DateCreated and DateModified to hold the history of record before SLCD at Datawarehouse.

Identified records which have changed correctly from Transform to Mirror.

Need to address UspPresentationDimGeneralPracticeAddress proc as at present the proc only updates the current record rather than persisting 2.

20/09/2017:

Completed and addressed issue with SLCD Type 2 for UspPresentationDimGeneralPracticeAddress.
